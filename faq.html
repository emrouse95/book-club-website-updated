            <li>Q. How do you pick the books?
                <p class="answer">A. We each submit a book that we think the group would like and then we randomly draw from thos options.</p>
                Q. What days of the week do you meet?
                <p class="answer">A. Typically we meet on the weekend since that is when everyone has a free day to get together.</p>
                Q. What happens if I fall behind or don't read the chosen books?
                <p class="answer">A. We understand life happens! Please, do not feel like you are excluded from any get-togethers for not reading the book. Whether you read it all, read part of it, or simply don't finish a book, we welcome you to still join any and all meetings you woud like!</p>
